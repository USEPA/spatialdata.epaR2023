# Visualization {#sec-visualization}


## Goals and Outcomes

* Understand how to use several of the most popular libraries for plotting and visualizing spatial data inR
* This is goal 2.
* This is goal 3.



## mapview

## leaflet

## ggplot2

## tmap

It uses the same syntax as ggplot: the grammar of graphics - it supports both static and interactive modes

### Plotting rasters and vectors with tmap
Bring in boundary and elevation of Crater Lake NP (datasets in `Rspatialworkshop` package) and plot with tmap
```{r tmap_raster_plot, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
library(Rspatialworkshop)
library(tmap)
data(CraterLake)
raster_filepath <- system.file("extdata", "elevation.tif", package = "Rspatialworkshop")
elevation <- rast(raster_filepath)

map_crlk <- tm_shape(CraterLake) + tm_polygons(lwd = 2)
map_crlkel = map_crlk +
  tm_shape(elevation) + tm_raster(alpha = 0.7,palette = terrain.colors(12)) + tm_layout(legend.position = c("left","bottom"),
          legend.width = 1)

map_crlkel
```
