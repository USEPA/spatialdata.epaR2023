His work supports various aspects of the USEPA’s National Aquatic Resource Surveys (NARS), which characterize the condition of waters across the United States, as he helped develop and maintains the StreamCat and LakeCat datasets. His work focuses on spatial analysis in R and Python, Geographic Information Science (GIS), aquatic ecology, remote sensing, open source science and environmental modeling\nMichael Dumelle is a statistician for the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). He works primarily on facilitating the survey design and analysis of USEPA’s National Aquatic Resource Surveys (NARS), which characterize the condition of waters across the United States. His primary research interests are in spatial statistics, survey design, environmental and ecological applications, and software development."

You can fork and clone this repository, or simply clone directly and open corresponding .qmd files to follow along with material in RStudio. You can also copy code snippets from the rendered book site and paste into your code files in RStudio.\nQuarto is a multi-language, next generation version of R Markdown from RStudio, with many new features and capabilities. Like R Markdown, Quarto uses Knitr to execute R code, and it can render most existing Rmd files without modification. Like RMarkdown the benefits include:\n\nAllows for reproducible reporting from R\nYou write your document in markdown and embed executable code chunks using the knitr syntax\nYou can update your document at any time by re-knitting the code chunks and convert your document to a number of formats (i.e. html, pdf, word documents)\nWe assume everyone in the workshop is familiar with using RStudio"
