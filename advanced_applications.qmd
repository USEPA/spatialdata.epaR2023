# Advanced Applications {#sec-advanced_applications}
We'll explore a few 'advanced' applications in this section, exploring the use of web services, exploring some means of using STAC resources in R, using R extensions, and some spatial modeling libraries

## Goals and Outcomes
* Gain familiarity with using web services for several applications in R
* Learn about using STAC resources in R
* Know about several extensions for integrating with other GIS software and tools in R
* Gain some familiarity with spatial modeling libraries
