# Foundations

## Goals

::: goals
1. Understand fundamental spatial data structures and libraries in **R**.
2. Become familiar with coordinate reference systems.
3. Geographic I/O (input/output).
:::

## Data Structures

* Review data structures section in workbook
* Cover vectors, matrices, arrays, lists, data frames, etc.
* Cover data frame manipulation using [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) functions and the pipe operator (`%>%` or `|>`)

## Why R for Spatial Data Analysis?

* Lightweight, open-source, and cross-platform
* Provides tools for automation and reproducibility
* Seamlessly integrates spatial data analysis and statistical analysis in one environment
* Handles vector and raster data

## R Drawbacks for GIS Work

* R is less interactive than desktop applications like ArcGIS or QGIS
* Handling coordinate reference systems is more challenging
* In-memory analysis can be prohibitive for large data
* Steep learning curve

## A Motivating Example

* Simple, expressive code

```{r}
#| warning: false
library(tmap)
library(tmaptools)
library(dplyr)

# find my town!
my_town <- tmaptools::geocode_OSM("Corvallis OR USA", as.sf = TRUE)
glimpse(my_town)
```

## Your Turn

::: task
1. What does `::` do?
2. What does `geocode_OSM()` do?
3. Explain how the code runs together using the  `|>` chaining operator
4. What is `glimpse()`?  How is it useful compared to `head()`?
:::

```{r}
#| echo: false

countdown(minutes = 5)
```

## Our Turn

::: task2
1. `::` lets you clarify from which package a function is called (e.g., `tmaptools::geocodeOSM()`)
2. `geocode_OSM()` looks up a named feature in OpenStreetMap and returns the coordinates
3. Do this `|>` then that
4. `glimpse()` glimpses at a data frame
:::

## A Choropleth Map

* A choropleth map is a map that connects statistical summaries to geographic characteristics
* The `tigris` package can retrieve census, county, and state boundaries as vector `sf` data

```{r}
#| label: fig-tmapexample
#| fig-cap: "Distribution of Oregon counties."
#| output-location: slide
#| fig-width: 8
#| results: hide
#| message: false
#| warning: false

library(tigris)
library(sf)
counties <- counties("Oregon", cb = TRUE)
counties$area <- as.numeric(st_area(counties))
glimpse(counties)

tm_shape(counties) +
  tm_polygons("area", style="quantile", title="Area of Oregon Counties")
```


## Your Turn

::: task
Create and explore an interactive map of `my_town` by running
```{r}
#| eval: false
library(mapview)
mapviewOptions(fgb=FALSE)
mapview(my_town, col="red", col.regions = "red") +
  mapview(counties, alpha.regions = .1)
```

:::

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false

library(mapview)
countdown(minutes = 4)
```

## Our Turn

```{r}
#| label: fig-mytowncounties
#| fig-cap: "Corvallis among distribution of Oregon counties."
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: "100%"
#| echo: false

knitr::include_graphics("img/mytown_counties.jpg")
```

## Spatial Data Structures

* Spatial data structures are primarily organized through:

1. GDAL [link here](https://gdal.org/): For raster and feature abstraction and processing
2. PROJ [link here](https://proj.org/): For coordinate transformations and projections
3. GEOS [link here](https://libgeos.org/): For spatial operations (e.g., calculating buffers or centroids) on data with a projected coordinate reference system (CRS)

* We explore these core libraries throughout the workshop

## Types of Spatial Data

* Vector data are comprised of points, lines, and polygons that represent discrete spatial entities (e.g., river, wtaershed, stream gauge)
* Raster data divide space into small rectangles (pixels) that represent spatially continuous phenomena like elevation or precipitation

## Types of Spatial Data

```{r}
#| label: fig-vectorraster
#| fig-cap: "Vector and raster data."
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: "100%"
#| echo: false

knitr::include_graphics("img/09-vec-raster.jpg")
```


## Vector Data Model

* Vector data are described using simple features
* Simple features is a standard way to specify how two-dimensional geometries are represented, stored in and retrieved from databases, and which geometric operations can be performed
* Provides framework for extending spatial `POINTS` to `LINES` and `POLYGONS`

## Types of Spatial Data

```{r}
#| label: fig-sfmodel
#| fig-cap: "The simple features data model."
#| fig-align: center
#| echo: false
#| out-width: "100%"

knitr::include_graphics("img/09-sf-model.png")
```

## The `sf` Package

* We use the `sf` package to work with spatial vector data in **R**
* Learn more about `sf` at their website [r-spatial.github.io/sf](r-spatial.github.io/sf) and/or by running
```{r}
#| eval: false

vignette(package = "sf") # see which vignettes are available
vignette("sf1")          # open the introduction vignette
```

## `sf` Primitives

* There are three basic `geometric` primitives with corresponding `sf` functions to create them:

1. `POINT`: created with `st_points()`
2. `LINESTRING`: created with `st_linestring()`
3. `POLYGON`: created with `st_polygon()`

* More complex simple feature geometries are built up using `st_multipoint()`, `st_multilinestring()`, `st_multipolygon()`, and `st_geometrycollection()`
* Building blocks for more complicated/large data structures

## `POINT`s

* Points in `sf` are composed of coordinate pairs and a coordinate reference system
* Points have no length or area
```{r}
# create sf object as point
pt1 <- st_point(c(1,3))
pt2 <- st_point(c(2,1))
pt3 <- st_point(c(3,2))
sf_point <- st_sfc(pt1, pt2, pt3)
```

```{r}
#| label: fig-sfpoint
#| fig-cap: "sf `POINT`"
#| output-location: slide

library(ggplot2)
ggplot(sf_point) + 
  geom_sf(color = "red") +
  labs(x = "X", y = "Y")
```

## `LINESTRING`s

* An ordered sequence of two or more `POINT`s
* Points in a line are called verticies (or nodes)
* Linestrings have length but no area

```{r}
# create sf object as linestring
line1 <- sf::st_linestring(rbind(pt1, pt2))
line2 <- sf::st_linestring(rbind(pt2, pt3))
sf_linestring <- st_sfc(line1, line2)
```

```{r}
#| label: fig-sflinestring
#| fig-cap: "sf `LINESTRING`"
#| output-location: slide

ggplot(sf_linestring) + 
  geom_sf() +
  labs(x = "X", y = "Y")
```

## `POLYGON`s

* Four or more points with the same starting and ending point
* Has length and area


```{r}
pt4 <- pt1
poly1 <- st_polygon(list(rbind(pt1, pt2, pt3, pt4)))
sf_polygon <- st_sfc(poly1)

# dimension
sf::st_dimension(sf_polygon)
```

```{r}
#| label: fig-sfpolygon
#| fig-cap: "sf `POLYGON`"
#| output-location: slide

ggplot(sf_polygon) + 
  geom_sf(fill = "grey")
```

## Putting Them All Together

```{r}
#| label: fig-sfallshape
#| fig-cap: "sf `POINT`, `LINESTRING`, and `POLYGON` overlain"
#| output-location: slide

ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = sf_point, color = "red") +
  geom_sf(data = sf_linestring) +
  geom_sf(data = sf_polygon, fill = "grey")
```

## Spatial Data Frames

* `sf` objects combine `data.frame` attributes with `POINT`, `LINESTRING`, and `POLYGON` building blocks (these are the `geometry`)
* Also characterize dimensionality, bounding box, coordinate reference system, attribute headers
* Read from shapefiles using `st_read()` or `read_sf()`

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| output-location: slide

library(spData)
data("us_states")
print(us_states)
```

## Spatial Data Frames

```{r}
#| label: fig-sfstructure
#| fig-cap: "The simple features data structure."
#| fig-align: center
#| echo: false
#| out-width: "100%"

knitr::include_graphics("img/sf_structure.png")
```

## Your Turn

::: task
So far we have explored plotting using `ggplot()`, but you can also use `sf`'s base plotting via `plot()`. Read more about plotting in `sf` by running `?plot.sf` and then make an appropriate plot of the `us_states` data.
:::

```{r}
#| echo: false

countdown(minutes = 5)
```

## Our Turn

::: task2
Running `plot()` in `sf` plots all variables; common to subset
:::

```{r}
#| label: fig-usarea
#| fig-cap: "Area by state in the US."
#| output-location: slide

plot(us_states["AREA"])
```


## Raster Data Model

* Raster data can be continuous or categorical
* Can be image based; have a temporal component

## Raster Data Model

```{r}
#| label: fig-rastermodel
#| fig-cap: "The raster data model."
#| fig-align: center
#| echo: false
#| out-width: "100%"

knitr::include_graphics("img/raster_data_model.jpg")
```

## The `terra` Package

* We use the `terra` package to work with spatial raster data in **R**
* `terra` is the modern replacement to `raster`
* Learn more about `terra` at their website [https://rspatial.org/](https://rspatial.org/)
* `stars` for spatio-temporal rasters

## Creating a Raster Object

* Create an empty `SpatRaster` object; define rows, columns, bounding box
```{r}
library(terra)
myrast <- rast(ncol = 10, nrow = 10, xmax = -116, xmin = -126, ymin = 42, ymax = 46)
str(myrast)
print(myrast)
```

## Your Turn

::: task
We just printed `myrast` and saw several components: `class`, `dimensions`, `resolution`, `extent`, and `coord. ref`. Explicitly return and inspect each of these pieces using `class()`, `ncell()`, `res()`, `ext()`, and `crs()`. Bonus: Return the number of raster cells using `ncell()`.
:::

```{r}
#| echo: false

countdown(minutes = 5)
```

## Our Turn

```{r}
class(myrast)
ncell(myrast)
res(myrast)
ext(myrast)
crs(myrast)
ncell(myrast)
```

## Manipulating Raster Objects

* Let's add values to the raster object
```{r}
values(myrast) <- 1:ncell(myrast)
```

```{r}
#| label: fig-rastplot
#| fig-cap: "Raster plot."
#| output-location: slide
#| fig-width: 8
#| results: hide
#| message: false
#| warning: false

plot(myrast)
```

## Reading a Raster Object

* Lets read in a raster object from the `spDataLarge` package that contains elevation data from Zion National Park

```{r}
raster_filepath <- system.file("raster/srtm.tif", package = "spDataLarge")
my_rast <- rast(raster_filepath)
```

```{r}
#| label: fig-rastplotzion
#| fig-cap: "Raster plot of elevation from Zion National Park."
#| output-location: slide
#| fig-width: 8
#| results: hide
#| message: false
#| warning: false

plot(my_rast)
```

## Your Turn

::: task
The `spatRaster` object in `terra` can hold multiple layers. Read in the four bands of Landsat 8 data from Zion National Park by running
```{r}
landsat <- system.file("raster/landsat.tif", package = "spDataLarge")
landsat <- rast(landsat)
```

Then plot this raster using `plot()`.

:::

```{r}
#| echo: false

countdown(minutes = 3)
```

## Our Turn

```{r}
#| label: fig-rastplotzion8
#| fig-cap: "Raster plot of Landsat 8 data from Zion National Park."
#| fig-width: 8
#| results: hide
#| message: false
#| warning: false

plot(landsat)
```


## Spatio-Temporal Raster Objects

* The `stars` package has tools for spatio-temporal raster data
* `stars` integrates with `sf` (recall that `terra` does not)
* Learn more at their website [https://r-spatial.github.io/stars/](https://r-spatial.github.io/stars/)

## Coordinate Reference Systems 

A coordinate reference system (CRS) is made up of several components

1. Coordinate system: The x,y grid that defines where your data lies in space
2. Horizontal and vertical units: The units that describe the coordinate system
3. Datum: The modeled version of the earth's shape
4. Projection details (if applicable): The mathematical equation used to flatten objects from round surface (earth) to flat surface (paper or screen)

## The Ellipsoid and Geoid

* The earth can be thought of as an ellipsoid defined by a semi-major (equatorial) axis and a semi-minor (polar) axis
* More precisely, it is a geoid that is not perfectly smooth
* A datum is built on top of the ellipsoid and incorporates local features
* The most appropriate datum depends on the location of interest (in the US we typically use NAD83)

## The Ellipsoid and Geoid

```{r}
#| label: fig-ellipse
#| fig-cap: "The ellipsoid and geoid."
#| fig-align: center
#| echo: false
#| out-width: "75%"

knitr::include_graphics("img/Ellipsoid.png")
```

## Your Turn

::: task
There are several websites that are helpful for learning more about specific coordinate reference systems

1. Spatial Reference: [https://spatialreference.org/](https://spatialreference.org/)
2. Projection Wizard: [https://projectionwizard.org/](https://projectionwizard.org/)
3. EPSG: [https://epsg.io/](https://epsg.io/)

Spend a few minutes learning about one or more of these references by visiting their websites.

:::

```{r}
#| echo: false

countdown(minutes = 4)
```

## Specifying a CRS

There are many ways to specify a CRS:

1. Proj4
    * `+proj = longlat + ellps=WGS84 ...`
2. OGC WKT / ESRI WKT
    * `GEOGCS["WGS 84", DATUM["WGS_1984, SPHERIOD["WGS 84 ...]]]`
3. authority:code identifier (modern/preferred)
    * `EPSG: 4326`
    
## Projected Coordinate Systems

* Projected coordinates have been projected to two-dimensional space according to a CRS
* Projected coordinates have an origin, x-axis, y-axis, and unit of measure
* Conformal projections preserve shape
* Equal-area projections preserve area
* Equidistant projections preserve distance
* Azimuthal projection preserves direction


## Projected Coordinate Systems

* Here an example using vector data; see the workbook for an example using raster data

```{r}
#| label: fig-transformcrs
#| fig-cap: "PNW State Boundaries."
#| output-location: slide
#| fig-width: 8
#| results: hide
#| message: false
#| warning: false

library(Rspatialworkshop)
data("pnw")
# transform one to the other
utmz11 <- 2153
pnw <- st_transform(pnw, crs = utmz11)
ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(data = pnw,  color="black", fill=NA) +
  labs(title="State Boundaries in the Pacific Northwest") +
  theme_bw() 
```

## Your Turn

::: task
Re-project the `pnw` data to a different projected CRS. Then plot using base **R** or `ggplot2`.
:::

```{r}
#| echo: false

countdown(minutes = 4)
```

## Our Turn

::: task2
 Project to NAD83
:::

```{r}
pnw2 <- st_transform(pnw, crs = 5070)
plot(st_geometry(pnw2))
```

## A Note on `S2`

* `sf` version `1.0.0` supports spherical geometry operations via its interface to Google's `S2` spherical geometry engine
* `S2` is an example of a Discrete Global Grid System (DGGS)
* `sf` can run with `s2` on or off and by default the S2 geometry engine is turned on:
```{r}
#| eval: false

sf::sf_use_s2()
```

## Geographic Data I/O (Input/Ouptut)

There are several ways to read spatial data into R

1. Load spatial data from our machine or a remote source
2. Load spatial data as part of an **R** package
3. Load data using an API (which often makes use of an **R** package)
4. Convert flat files with x, y coordinates to spatial data
5. Geocoding data "by-hand" (we saw this earlier)

## Vector Data I/O

`sf` can read numerous file types:

1. shapefiles
2. geodatabases
3. geopackages
4. geojson
5. spatial database files

## Read in a Shapefile

```{r}
#| label: fig-citylims
#| fig-cap: "Oregon City Limits"
#| output-location: slide
#| fig-width: 8
#| results: hide
#| message: false
#| warning: false

filepath <- system.file("extdata/city_limits.shp", package = "Rspatialworkshop")
citylims <- read_sf(filepath)
plot(st_geometry(citylims), axes = T, main = "Oregon City Limits")
```

## Your Turn

::: task
Run `?read_sf()` and compare `read_sf()` to `st_read()`. Our preference is to use `read_sf()` -- why do you think that is?
:::

```{r}
#| echo: false

countdown(minutes = 3)
```

## Our Turn

::: task2
 
`read_sf()` calls `st_read()` with defaults chosen:
 
- `stringsAsFactors = FALSE`
- `quiet = TRUE`
- `as_tibble = TRUE`
 
:::

## Read in a Geodatabase

```{r}
#| label: fig-stateparks
#| fig-cap: "State Park Boundaries"
#| output-location: slide
#| fig-width: 8
#| results: hide
#| message: false
#| warning: false

filepath <- system.file("extdata/StateParkBoundaries.gdb", package = "Rspatialworkshop")
# List all feature classes in a file geodatabase
st_layers(filepath)
# Read the feature class
parks <- st_read(dsn = filepath, layer="StateParkBoundaries")
ggplot(parks) + 
  geom_sf()
```

## Read in a Geopackage

```{r}
#| label: fig-nc
#| fig-cap: "North Carolina Counties"
#| output-location: slide
#| fig-width: 8
#| results: hide
#| message: false
#| warning: false

filepath <- system.file("gpkg/nc.gpkg", package="sf")
nc <- read_sf(filepath)
ggplot(nc) + 
  geom_sf()
```

## Geopackage Advantages

Why use geopackages over shapefiles?

1. Geopackages avoid mult-file format of shapefiles
2. Geopackages avoid the 2gb limit of shapefiles
3. Geopackages are open-source and follow OGC standards
4. Geopackages are lighter in file size than shapefiles
5. Geopackages avoid the 10-character limit to column headers in shapefile attribute tables (stored in archaic `.dbf` files)

## Other Approaches

The workbook shows how to read in data using 

1. Open spatial data sources
2. **R** packages
3. OpenStreetMap

## Raster Data I/O

* Read in data using `rast()`

```{r}
#| label: fig-barelev
#| fig-cap: "Elevation Data Barplot"
#| output-location: slide
#| fig-width: 8
#| results: hide
#| message: false
#| warning: false

filepath <- system.file("ex/elev.tif", package="terra")
elev <- rast(filepath)
barplot(elev, digits = -1, las = 2, ylab = "Frequency")
```

## Raster Data I/O

```{r}
#| label: fig-elev
#| fig-cap: "Elevation Data"
#| fig-width: 8
#| results: hide
#| message: false
#| warning: false

plot(elev)
```

## Raster Data I/O

```{r}
#| label: fig-L7
#| fig-cap: "Landsat 7"
#| output-location: slide
#| fig-width: 8
#| results: hide
#| message: false
#| warning: false

library(stars)
filepath <- system.file("tif/L7_ETMs.tif", package = "stars")
L7 <- read_stars(filepath) |>
  slice(index = 1, along = "band")
plot(L7)
```

## Convert Flat Files to Spatial

It is common for a flat file (e.g., a `.csv`) to have columns that indicate coordinates -- how do we turn this into a spatial vector object?

```{r}
#| label: fig-gagesflat
#| fig-cap: "Stream Gages From a Flat File"
#| output-location: slide
#| fig-width: 8
#| results: hide
#| message: false
#| warning: false

filepath <- system.file("extdata/Gages_flowdata.csv", package = "Rspatialworkshop")
gages <- read.csv(filepath)
gages_sf <- gages |>
  st_as_sf(coords = c("LON_SITE", "LAT_SITE"), crs = 4269, remove = FALSE)
ggplot(data = gages_sf) + 
  geom_sf()
```

# Visualization

## Goals

::: goals
* Gain familiarity with plotting and visualizing spatial data in R
* Work with four specific visualization and plotting libraries:
  + `ggplot2`
  + `leaflet`
  + `mapview`
  + `tmap`
:::

## Some Advice

Some advice from Martin Tennekes:

- If you know some `ggplot`, don't care about interactive maps, and don't want to spend a lot of time learning new packages, use `ggplot`
- If you want interactive maps as flexible as possible, use `leaflet`
- If you want to simply explore spatial objects ineractively as easily as possible, use `mapview`
- Otherwise, use `tmap`!

Projections are important!

## `ggplot2`

`ggplot2` now supports `geom_sf()`, developed alongside `sf` for pulication quality figures that easily incorporate projections

```{r}
library(tidycensus)
library(cowplot)
mult_tracts <- get_acs(state='OR',county='Multnomah',geography='tract', variables=c('B19013_001','B16010_028','B01003_001'), geometry=TRUE) 

# tidy data
mult_wide <- mult_tracts |> 
  sf::st_transform(2153) |> #UTM 11N
  dplyr::filter(!is.na(estimate)) |> 
  tidyr::pivot_wider(
    names_from = c("variable"),
    values_from = c("estimate","moe")
  ) |> 
  dplyr::rename(Median_Income=estimate_B19013_001, College_Education=estimate_B16010_028,Total_Pop=estimate_B01003_001) |> 
  dplyr::mutate(Perc_College_Ed = (College_Education / Total_Pop) * 100) |> 
  dplyr::filter(!is.na(Median_Income) & !is.na(Perc_College_Ed))
```

## `ggplot2`

```{r}
#| label: fig-medianmc
#| fig-cap: "Median income in Multnomah County."
#| fig-width: 8
#| results: hide
#| message: false
#| warning: false

mult_wide |> 
  ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(aes(fill = Median_Income)) + 
  scale_y_continuous() +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "mako") +
  theme_minimal_grid(12)
```


## `ggplot2`

```{r}
#| label: fig-collegemc
#| fig-cap: "Percent college degree in Multnomah County."
#| fig-width: 8
#| results: hide
#| message: false
#| warning: false

# Geoprocessing

## Goals

::: goals
* Learn about fundamental spatial operations in R using spatial predicates in `sf` for geometric operations
* Explore performing 'map algebra' type operations with raster data in R
* Learn how to do extract and zonal operations in R
:::

## Libraries

Recall that `sf` has functions to access three primary underlying geospatial libraries:

1. `GDAL`: For reading and writing data
2. `GEOS`: For geometrical operations
3. `PROJ` for projection conversions and datum transformations

We leverage `sf` and these libraries to perform subsetting, joins, buffering, unions, intersections, clipping, and more

## Simple Features

* `LINESTRING`s are simple if they don't self-intersect
* `POLYGON`s are simple if their rings are closed, holes are self-contained, and rings don't repeat their own path

## Predicates

* A predicate asserts whether a property is `TRUE`
* A predicate is unary if it describes the property of a (single) geometry
    * `is`, `is_simple`, `is_valid()`, `is_empty()`, etc.
* A predicate is binary if it describes the property of two geometries
    * `contains()`, `equals()`, `intersects()`, `touches()`, `within()`, etc.
    
## Measures and Units

Leverage GEOS to answer questions like:

* How long is a line or polygon perimeter?
* What is the area of a polygon?
* What is the distance between two objects?

## Calculating Distances

* Using `st_area()`
```{r}
counties_area <- sum(st_area(counties))
paste0("The total area of all counties in Oregon is ", round(counties_area), " square meters.")
```

* Between stream gages
```{r}
st_distance(gages_sf[1,], gages_sf[2,])
```

## Your Turn

::: task
We just calculated the distances between two stream gages in square meters. What if we wanted distance in different units? You can:
 
 * Set a projection that uses the proper units
 * Use the `units` **R** package to explicitly set units on a vector
 * Apply the conversion factor manually
 
Use one of these approaches to return the same stream gage distance using different units
:::

```{r}
#| echo: false

countdown(minutes = 4)
```

## Our Turn

```{r}
# setting projection
gages_ft <- st_transform(gages_sf, 2994)
st_distance(gages_ft[1,], gages_ft[2,])
```

## Spatial Subsetting

* Use subset notation (`[]`) to take a spatial object and return a new spatial object that contains only the features that relate in space to another spatial object

```{r}
#| eval: false

library(AOI)
filepath <- system.file("extdata/cities.shp", package = "Rspatialworkshop")
or_cities <- read_sf(filepath)
mult_cnty <- aoi_get(state = "OR", county= "Multnomah") |> 
  st_transform(st_crs(or_cities))
mult_cities <- or_cities[mult_cnty, , op = st_intersects]
mapview(mult_cnty, alpha.regions=.07, color='black', lwd=2) +
  mapview(mult_cities)
```

## Spatial Subsetting

```{r}
#| echo: false

library(AOI)
filepath <- system.file("extdata/cities.shp", package = "Rspatialworkshop")
or_cities <- read_sf(filepath)
mult_cnty <- aoi_get(state = "OR", county= "Multnomah") |> 
  st_transform(st_crs(or_cities))
mult_cities <- or_cities[mult_cnty, , op = st_intersects]
```


```{r}
#| label: fig-multcities
#| fig-cap: "Cities in Multnomah County."
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: "100%"
#| echo: false

knitr::include_graphics("img/mult_cities.jpg")
```

## Your Turn

::: task 
Now subset all cities within 50,000 meters of a Multnomah county boundary (hint, use the `st_is_within_distance` predicate and the `dist` argument). Then visualize these sites overlain onto the county boundaries using `mapview()`
:::

```{r}
#| echo: false

countdown(minutes = 4)
```

## Our Turn

```{r}
#| eval: false
close_mult_cities <- or_cities[mult_cnty, , op=st_is_within_distance,dist=50000]
mapview(mult_cnty, alpha.regions=.07, color='black', lwd=2) +
  mapview(close_mult_cities)
```

## Our Turn

```{r}
#| label: fig-multcities2
#| fig-cap: "Cities within 50,000 meters of a Multnomah County boundary."
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: "100%"
#| echo: false

knitr::include_graphics("img/close_mult_cities.jpg")
```

## Spatial Join

We may want to join together information from one spatial data with another spatial data set

```{r}
counties <- aoi_get(state='Oregon', county='all') |> 
  st_transform(st_crs(or_cities))
cty_cnty <- st_join(or_cities, counties['name'], .predicate = st_intersects)
glimpse(cty_cnty)
```

## Spatial Join

* Left join is the default: Keep all variables from `x` and add variables from `y` that match a key in `x`
* Inner join: A left join but remove rows that don't have a matching key in `y`

## Buffer and Dissolve

You may want to create buffers around locations

```{r}
# Filter for metro areas
metros <- or_cities |> 
  dplyr::filter(CITY %in% c('PORTLAND','SALEM','EUGENE','CORVALLIS','BEND','MEDFORD'))
# Buffer larger cities
metro_areas <- metros |> 
  st_buffer(105600)
```

```{r}
#| eval: false

mapview(metro_areas)
```

## Buffer and Dissolve

```{r}
#| label: fig-citybuffer
#| fig-cap: "Large Oregon cities with a 20 mile buffer."
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: "100%"
#| echo: false

knitr::include_graphics("img/or_cities_buffer.jpg")
```

## Buffer and Dissolve

Several tidyverse functions to easily dissolve:

```{r}
counties |>
  group_by(combined_area_code) |>
  summarize(mean_land_area = mean(land_area))
```

## Clipping

```{r}
#| label: fig-metrogeom
#| fig-cap: "Metro area geometry."
#| output-location: slide
#| fig-width: 8
#| results: hide
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| fig-show: hold

plot(st_geometry(metro_areas[2, ]), axes=TRUE) 
plot(st_geometry(counties[metro_areas[2,], ]), border = "grey", add = TRUE)
```


## Clipping

Keep only intersecting geometry

```{r}
#| label: fig-metroclip
#| fig-cap: "Metro area geometry clipped."
#| output-location: slide
#| fig-width: 8
#| results: hide
#| message: false
#| warning: false

metro_county_area <- st_intersection(metro_areas[2,], counties)
plot(st_geometry(metro_county_area), border = "grey", axes = TRUE) 
```

## Centroids and Type Transformations

A centroid is the center of mass on a feature:

```{r}
sel_counties <- counties |> 
  dplyr::filter(name %in% c('Marion','Yamhill','Polk','Benton','Multnomah','Clackamas','Linn','Washington'))
cnt_cent1 <- st_centroid(sel_counties)
```

```{r}
#| eval: false
tm_shape(sel_counties) +
  tm_borders() +
  tm_shape(cnt_cent1) +
  tm_symbols(shape = 1, col = "black", size = 0.5) 
```

## Centroids and Type Transformations

```{r}
#| label: fig-centroids
#| fig-cap: "Centroids for Oregon select counties."
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: "100%"
#| echo: false

knitr::include_graphics("img/or_centroids.jpg")
```

## Your Turn

::: task
Sometimes the centroid of a geometry does not lie within the geometry's boundaries. The function `st_point_on_surface()` acts similarly but requires this point is on the surface. In the previous code to visualize the centroids, replace `st_centroid()` with `st_point_on_surface()` and re-visualize.
:::

```{r}
#| echo: false

countdown(minutes = 3)
```

## Our Turn

```{r}
cnt_cent2 <- st_point_on_surface(sel_counties)
```

```{r}
#| eval: false

tm_shape(sel_counties) +
  tm_borders() +
  tm_shape(cnt_cent2) +
  tm_symbols(shape = 1, col = "red", size = 0.5) 
```

## Our Turn

```{r}
#| label: fig-centroids2
#| fig-cap: "Point on surface for Oregon select counties."
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: "100%"
#| echo: false

knitr::include_graphics("img/or_surface.jpg")
```

## Centroids and Type Transformations

* `st_centroid()` and `st_point_on_surface()` transform all geometries into `POINT` geometries
* This is a specific application of a spatial "casting", which casts geometries from one type to another
* `st_cast()` in `sf

## Simplification

* It can be useful to simplify geometries to save memory and improve efficiency

```{r}
#| label: fig-santiam
#| fig-cap: "South Santiam geometry and simplified geometry."
#| output-location: slide
#| fig-width: 8
#| results: hide
#| message: false
#| warning: false

SouthSantiam <- dataRetrieval::findNLDI(nwis = "14187200", nav = "UT", find = "flowlines", distance_km=10)
SouthSantiam <- SouthSantiam$UT_flowlines |>
  st_transform(st_crs(counties))

Sant_simp <-  st_simplify(SouthSantiam, dTolerance = 500)  # 500 m
p1 <-  tm_shape(SouthSantiam) +
  tm_lines() 
p2 <-  tm_shape(Sant_simp) +
  tm_lines() 
tmap_arrange(p1, p2, ncol = 2)
```
